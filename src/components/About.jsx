          <p>I am a software engineer skilled in both the front and back-end of web development. As a former professional helicopter pilot Iâ€™ve learned the skill of solving problems independently and the art of effectively communicating and collaborating with a team. My curiosity led me to software engineering and an industry whose limits are only self imposed.</p>
